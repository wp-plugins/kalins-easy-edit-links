== Description ==

<p>
Adds a customizable box to your edit screens with links and edit buttons for all pages, posts, tags, categories, attachments, links and custom post types for convenient linking.               
</p>

<p>This plugin contains a self-caching feature so that the HTML code does not need to be recompiled every time the box is displayed, making it surprisingly light-weight.

1. Unzip `kalins-easy-edit-links.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. These are the options available on the settings page. Customize order and abbreviations in the right panel.


== Changelog ==

= 0.7 =
* First version. Beta. Has pages, posts, tags, categories and links. Settings include enable cache, height, text length, show drafts, show future and show private.

= 1.0 =
* Added custom post type support
* Added column for attachments
* Added ability to select which post types to show
* Added ability to customize order and abbreviation of columns

= 1.1 =
*after upgrading to 1.0 on my live site, a PHP error was being thrown due to something wacky in my post content. Maybe I had bad markup or corrupt characters in a post or something. I fixed this by turning off excerpts, so I added a checkbox to select whether or not you want excerpts added as link titles.
