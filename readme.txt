== Description ==

<p>
Adds a box to your page/post edit screen with links and edit buttons for all pages, posts, tags, categories, and links for convenient linking.                
</p>

<p>This plugin contains a self-caching feature so that the HTML code does not need to be recompiled every time the box is displayed, making it surprisingly light-weight.
